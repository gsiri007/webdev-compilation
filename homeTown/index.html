                        my greatest joy. You'll often find me in my traditional sarong, a smile on my face, 
                        ready to weave tales of our history in Sinhala, Tamil, or English.
                        From the sacred Temple of the Tooth to that little stall with the best kottu roti – trust me,
                        I know all the secrets. Come, let me show you my Kandy."
